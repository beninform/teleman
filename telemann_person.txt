Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767) was a German Baroque composer and multi-instrumentalist. 

Telemann is one of the most prolific composers in history, at least in terms of surviving oeuvre. 
He was considered by his contemporaries to be one of the leading German composers of the time, 
and he was compared favourably both to his friend Johann Sebastian Bach, who made Telemann the godfather 
and namesake of his son Carl Philipp Emanuel, and to George Frideric Handel, whom Telemann also knew personally. 
As part of his duties, he wrote a considerable amount of music for educating organists under his direction.

Almost completely self-taught in music, he became a composer against his family's wishes. 
After studying in Magdeburg, Zellerfeld, and Hildesheim, Telemann entered the University of Leipzig to study law, 
but eventually settled on a career in music. He held important positions in Leipzig, Sorau, Eisenach, and Frankfurt 
before settling in Hamburg in 1721, where he became musical director of the city's five main churches. 
While Telemann's career prospered, his personal life was always troubled: his first wife died less than two years 
after their marriage, and his second wife had extramarital affairs and accumulated a large gambling debt before leaving him.
